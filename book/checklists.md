# Code quality assurance checklists

```{note}
This section is an early draft. This sections aims to provide a checklist for quality assurance of analytical projects in government. Please get in touch with feedback [by creating a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/qa-of-code-guidance/issues) or via [gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk](mailto:gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk).

As per the [Aqua book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government), quality assurance should be proportionate to the risk of your analysis. With this in mind, we have provided checklists for three levels of quality assurance. The risk profiles of organisations differ from one another so no general rules can be made about which level to use for every bit of analysis. Organisations might want to consider making their own versions of these checklists.

As examples: high risk analysis would include cost-benefit models that underpin billion pound business cases. Moderate risk analysis might include a data science model that extracts topics from responses to a consultation - depending on the policy under consultation - or official statistics with hundreds of known users. A model that predicts stationery expenditure for a division would probably be low risk.

We recommend that you consider the risk and complexity associated with your project. Given your assessment, you should copy and tailor the checklists that we have provided. You may choose to select only some elements from each level of quality assurance to address the specific risks associated with your work. [These risks include financial, legal, operational and reputational impacts.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416478/aqua_book_final_web.pdf#page=10)

If time constraints prevent you from performing risk-appropriate QA you must let your commissioners and users know the risks of using your analysis. This will help to inform their understanding of the strength of the evidence. Caveats allow you to convey what was possible in the time available, and to indicate the risks that have still not been appropriately mitigated.
